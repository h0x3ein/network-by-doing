# OSI Layer
|Layers|Description|
| --- | --- |
|Application|the interface permitting the user to send and receive data through clients and applications|
|Presentation|converts the request from the application into a universal format|
|Session|permits the ability to open, close, and manage a session between the process and response|
|Transport|efines how data will be sent, providing **validation** and security|
|Network|looks for the best path to reach the destination [ IP ]|
|Data Link|handles communication between adjacent nodes [ MAC ]|
|Physical|handles bit level transmission between network nodes|

## Application
**Conseptual** -> `The phone` is the interface used by the user to place the order.

**actual** -> a user clicking on a link within a web browser. The browser application provides the interface for the user to interact with the content provided by the remote web server

## Presentation
**conceptual** the individual using the telephone needs to be speaking a language the person on the other end can understand.

**actual** the web browser renders the page by converting the files stored on the remote server into formats that permit displaying the content. In the case of the web browser, this includes image formats such as jpeg and gif being converted into actual images on the screen.
