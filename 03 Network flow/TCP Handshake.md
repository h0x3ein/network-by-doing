## TCP HANDSHAKE :: DEFINITION
- Transmission Control Protocol
- TCP exists in `Layer 4`, along with UDP
- Highly reliable connection protocol through `Positive Acknowledgement with Retransmission (PAR)`
- Data is re-sent if an `acknowledgement` isnâ€™t received
- The layer 4 data is referred to as `segments`, each segment contains a `checksum` for verification upon receipt
- If verification succeeds, an `acknowledgement` is sent
- If verification `fails`, the receiver discards that segment and waits for retransmission
